# Simple-Handwritten-Digit_Recognition

1. Loading Libraries and Dataset:

 You start by installing the necessary packages and importing libraries, including TensorFlow for building and
 training neural networks. You load the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9) 
 along with their corresponding labels.

2. Exploring Dataset:

 You print the label of the second training sample and display its image using Matplotlib. This is a quick 
 exploration to understand the data.

3. Preprocessing Data:

 You normalize the pixel values of the images to be in the range [0, 1]. Additionally, you reshape the images
 to have a single channel, as the original images are grayscale.

4. Defining Model and Data Augmentation:

 You define a neural network architecture using the create_model function. The model consists of densely 
 connected layers with dropout for regularization.
 A KerasClassifier is created, wrapping the model, with some initial hyperparameter values.
 An ImageDataGenerator is set up for data augmentation, which introduces variations to the training images,
 making the model more robust.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:

 You define a search space for hyperparameters (params_tuning) including learning rate, layer sizes, 
 dropout rates, epochs, and batch sizes.
 Using RandomizedSearchCV, you search for the best hyperparameters within the defined space. The model is
 evaluated using cross-validation.

6. Training Model with Best Hyperparameters:

 You create a new instance of the model using the best hyperparameters obtained from the random search.
 The model is trained using the augmented data generated by the ImageDataGenerator.
 Saving the Best Model:

 The best-trained model is saved to a file for later use. This is important to preserve the model's architecture
 and learned weights.

7. Evaluating Model on Test Data:

 The performance of the model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its generalization to unseen data. 
 Test accuracy is calculated.

8. Loading and Using the Model for Prediction:

 The saved model is loaded, and a predict function is defined to make predictions on new images.
 A test image is chosen from the MNIST dataset, and the predict function is used to display the image and
 the model's predicted label.
